Through 2 case studies, the module will aim at sensitize the audience about the gaps that may exist between an invention and its possible product application. A “check-list” listing the evaluation criteria and related questions that an inventor should ask himself for this evaluation will be built by the participants and a synthesis will be provided at the end of the module."
