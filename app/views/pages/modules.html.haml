A “check-list” listing the evaluation criteria and related questions that an inventor should ask himself for this evaluation will be built by the participants and a synthesis will be provided at the end of the module."

As an inventor, having contributed to such technologies and inventions is a great achievement, but, in order to bring them to the market, licensing to industry is a "must" - and it is an absolute reward for the inventors to help making it happen.<br /> This module focuses on licensing, the most common way to transfer technologies. It is a very interactive module combining case studies and examples to illustrate the essential components of the license agreement. It also aims to provide a basis for licensing negotiations.'
